The said project was done as a part of final project for Statistics 6021: Introduction to Linear Regression Models. 
The goal was to predict quality ranks of wines based on a number of physico-chemical properties like acidity, sulphur content, alcohol content, etc.

The model used was a probabilistic odds logistic regression model.
